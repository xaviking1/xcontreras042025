# Transport in Plants

## Vascular tissue- tiny tubes that transports food and water to veins

### phloem transports food = glucose

### xylem transports water

Plants take up water from the roots and transport it through the xylem to the leaves, where photosynthesis takes place. The plants manufacture glucose from water and carbon dioxide using light energy in their leaves. This glucose is then moved through the phloem to the rest of the plant to serve as a source of energy and growth or stored in the form of starch.
